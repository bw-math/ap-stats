In this project, you will perform some graphical analysis on a famous data set. 

Background
==========

In the years 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, the Selective Service System held a draft lottery for men born from January 1, 1944 to December 31, 1950 [DRAFT]_.

In 1969, the first year they held the draft, the method used to select individuals for service was heavily flawed. 365 days of the year were printed on sheets of paper and placed in a shoebox.

    { January 1, January 2, ... , Feburary 1, February 2, ... , December 30, December 31 }

Slips of paper were then selected at random and anyone of eligible age who had a birthday on the date indicated would be drafted. The important point is *individuals who shared the same birth day* would be drafted at the same time. As example, two men who had the birthdays April 5 :sup:`th`, 1946 and April 5:sup:`th`, 1947 would both be drafted in the event a slip of paper for "April 5" was selected.
