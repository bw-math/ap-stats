Population
    The *population* is the set of all possible individuals that can be observed in a given experiment.

Methods of Observation
----------------------

Census
    A *census* is a type of statistical study where each individual in the population is observed.

Sample 
    A *sample* is a type of statistical study where a subset of the population is observed *at random*.

Classifications of Data
-----------------------

Dimensionality

    The *dimension* of a dataset are the number of values associated with a single observation.

    Univariate

        *Univariate* data consists of observations that each contain a single value.

        :math:`\{ x_1, x_2, x_3 \}`

    Bivariate
        *Bivariate* data consists of observations that each contain two values (i.e. an *pair*)

        :math:`\{ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ... , (x_n, y_n)\}`

    Multivariate 
        *Multivariate* data consists of observations that each contain an arbitrary number of values (i.e. a *vector*)

        :math:`\{ (x_{1}^1, x_{2}^1, ... , x_{n}^1 ), (x_{1}^2, x_{2}^2, ... , x_{n}^2 ), ... ,(x_{1}^m, x_{2}^m, ... , x_{n}^m )`

Characteristic

    The *characteristic* of a dataset is the *type* of data being observed.

    Qualitative
        Qualitative data are categorical.

        Ex. 
            :math:`\{ "Red", "Blue", "Yellow"\}`

    Quantitative
        Quantitative data are numerical. 

        Discrete 
            Discrete quantitative data is countable.

            Ex.
                :math:`\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... \}`

        Continuous
            Continuous quantitative data  is infinitely divisible 

            Ex.

                :math:`\{ 1.0, 1.01, 1.001, 1.0001, 1.00001, ... \}`

Scale 
    Nominal Level
        Unordered, categorical data.

        Ex.

            TODO

    Ordinal Level
        Ordered, categorical data.

        Ex. 

            TODO

    Interval/Ratio Level 
        Ordered, numerical data.

.. _statistics_defintions:

Types of Statistics
-------------------

Sample Statistic
    A piece of information that characterizes the shape and spread of a sample.

Descriptive Statistic 
    A sample statisic used to visualize and approximate the shape and spread of a population.

Inferential Statistic
    A sample statistic used to make inferences about the population.
