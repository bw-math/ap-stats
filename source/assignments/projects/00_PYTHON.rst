    What I cannot create, I do not understand.
    - Richard Feynman
    
In this lab, you will install **Python** and learn some of its basic functions. 

Instructions
============

1. Create a folder named `LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_project_zero`, replacing `LASTNAME` and `FIRSTNAME` with your last name and first name, respectively.
2. In the same folder, create a Python *py* script named `project_zero.py`
3. Read the :ref:`project_zero_project` section. Complete all indicated exercises.
4. When you are done, zip your folder and all its contents in a file named `LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_project_zero.zip`
5. Upload the zip file here: TODO

Background
==========

Like windmills and Heineken, **Python** is a product of the Netherlands. It was invented in the 1980s by Guido van Rossum, an engineer at **Microsoft**. Technically, **Python** is a language `specification <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html>`_, a set of grammatical rules and syntax. Any program that *implements* this specification is considered "**Python**". The actual implementation details vary depending on which **Python** `engine you are running <https://www.jython.org/jython-old-sites/archive/21/docs/differences.html>`_. Popular implementations of **Python** have been written in **Java** and **C**. However, these are details we will never need to know. We are *using* **Python** as an already built tool, not *studying* **Python** in order to understand how it was built. 

**Python** is a very popular tool. Google `python AND data science <https://www.google.com/search?q=python+in+data+science>`_ and you will get a half billion results. 

.. tip:: 
    
    The upper-case "AND" in the search suggestion is a `Google search operator <https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/>`_. Learn how to Google effectively and it will save a ton of time!

In the last decade, **Python** has become the go-to tool for conducting data analysis. There is a reason for this: **Python** is easy to learn and easy to use. You don't need any prior programming experience (although a few math classes help!), so you can focus on the problems you are actually solving rather than learning syntax. 

`Python has excellent documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`_. If you are ever in doubt (or just want to know more), try using the search bar on the documentation to find an answer:
