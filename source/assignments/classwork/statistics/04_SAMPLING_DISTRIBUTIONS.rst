A professional sports team evaluates potential players for a certain position based on two main characteristics, speed and strength.

a. Speed is measured by the time required to run a distance of 40 yards, with smaller times indicating more desirable (faster) speeds. From previous speed data for all players in this position, the times to run 40 yards have a mean of 4.60 seconds and a standard deviation of 0.15 seconds, with a minimum time of 4.40 seconds, as shown in the table below.

+----------------------+---------+--------------------+---------+
|                      | Mean    | Standard Deviation | Minimum |
+----------------------+---------+--------------------+---------+
| Time to run 40 yards |  4.60 s |  0.15 seconds      |  4.40 s |
+----------------------+---------+--------------------+---------+

Based on the relationship between the mean, standard deviation, and minimum time, is it reasonable to believe that the distribution of 40-yard running times is approximately normal? Explain.

.. hint::

    Think about the :ref:`empirical_rule`!

b. Strength is measured by the amount of weight lifted, with more weight indicating more desirable (greater) strength. From previous strength data for all players in this position, the amount of weight lifted has a mean of 310 pounds and a standard deviation of 25 pounds, as shown in the table below.

+-------------------------+---------+--------------------+
|                         | Mean    | Standard Deviation |
+-------------------------+---------+--------------------+
| Amount of weight lifted |  310 lb |      25 lb         |
+-------------------------+---------+--------------------+

Calculate and interpret the z-score for a player in this position who can lift a weight of 370 pounds.

c. The characteristics of speed and strength are considered to be of equal importance to the team in selecting a player for the position. Based on the information about the means and standard deviations of the speed and strength data for all players and the measurements listed in the table below for Players A and B, which player should the team select if the team can only select one of the two players? Justify your answer.

Each full carton of Grade A eggs consists of 1 randomly selected empty cardboard container and 12 randomly selected eggs. The weights of such full cartons are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 840 grams and a standard deviation of 7.9 grams.

a. What is the probability that a randomly selected full carton of Grade A eggs will weigh more than 850 grams?

b. The weights of the empty cardboard containers have a mean of 20 grams and a standard deviation of 1.7 grams. It is reasonable to assume independence between the weights of the empty cardboard containers and the weights of the eggs. It is also reasonable to assume independence among the weights of the 12 eggs that are randomly selected for a full carton.

Let the random variable **X** be the weight of a single randomly selected Grade A egg.

    i. What is the mean of **X **?
    ii. What is the standard deviation of **X** ?

Schools in a certain state receive funding based on the number of students who attend the school. To determine the number of students who attend a school, one school day is selected at random and the number of students in attendance that day is counted and used for funding purposes. The daily number of absences at High School A in the state is approximately normally distributed with mean of 120 students and Standard deviation of 10.5 students.

a. If more than 140 students are absent on the day the attendance count is taken for funding purposes, the school will lose some of its state funding in the subsequent year. Approximately what is the probability that High School A will lose some state funding?

b. The principals' association in the state suggests that instead of choosing one day at random, the state should choose 3 days at random. With the suggested plan, High School A would lose some of its state funding in the subsequent year if the mean number of students absent for the 3 days is greater than 140. Would High School A be more likely, less likely, or equally likely to lose funding using the suggested plan compared to the plan described in part *a*? Justify your choice.

c. A typical school week consists of the days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The principal at High School A believes that the number of absences tends to be greater on Mondays and Fridays, and there is concern that the school will lose state funding if the attendance count occurs on a Monday or Friday. If one school day is chosen at random from each of 3 typical school weeks, what is the probability that none of the 3 days chosen is a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday?

A grocery store purchases melons from two distributors, J and K. Distributor J provides melons from organic farms. The distribution of the diameters of the melons from Distributor J is approximately normal with mean 133 millimeters (mm) and standard deviation 5 mm.

a. For a melon selected at random from Distributor J, what is the probability that the melon will have a diameter greater than 137 mm?

b. Distributor K provides melons from nonorganic farms. The probability is 0.8413 that a melon selected at random from Distributor K will have a diameter greater than 137 mm. For all the melons at the grocery store, 70 percent of the melons are provided by Distributor J and 30 percent are provided by Distributor K.

    i. For a melon selected at random from the grocery store, what is the probability that the melon will have a diameter greater than 137 mm?

    ii. Given that a melon selected at random from the grocery store has a diameter greater than 137 mm, what is the probability that the melon will be from Distributor J?

A company that manufactures smartphones developed a new battery that has a longer life span than that of a traditional battery. From the date of purchase of a smartphone, the distribution of the life span of the new battery is approximately normal with mean 30 months and standard deviation 8 months. For the price of $50, the company offers a two-year warranty on the new battery for customers who purchase a smartphone. The warranty guarantees that the smartphone will be replaced at no cost to the customer if the battery no longer works within 24 months from the date of purchase.

a. In how many months from the date of purchase is it expected that 25 percent of the batteries will no longer work? Justify your answer.

b. Suppose one customer who purchases the warranty is selected at random. What is the probability that the customer selected will require a replacement within 24 months from the date of purchase because the battery no longer works?

c. The company has a gain of $50 for each customer who purchases a warranty but does not require a replacement. The company has a loss (negative gain) of $150 for each customer who purchases a warranty and does require a replacement. What is the expected value of the gain for the company for each warranty purchased?

The depth from the surface of Earth to a refracting layer beneath the surface can be estimated using methods developed by seismologists. One method is based on the time required for vibrations to travel from a distant explosion to a receiving point. The depth measurement **M** is the sum of the true depth **D** and the random measurement error **E**. That is, :math:`M = D + E`. The measurement error **E** is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 feet and standard deviation 1.5 feet.

a. If the true depth at a certain point is 2 feet, what is the probability that the depth measurement will be negative?

b. Suppose three independent depth measurements are taken at the point where the true depth is 2 feet. What is the probability that at least one of these measurements will be negative?

.. hint:: 

    What is the complement of "*at least one*"? Refer to :ref:`square_of_opposition`!

c. What is the probability that the mean of the three independent depth measurements taken at the point where the true depth is 2 feet will be negative?
