The depth from the surface of Earth to a refracting layer beneath the surface can be estimated using methods developed by seismologists. One method is based on the time required for vibrations to travel from a distant explosion to a receiving point. The depth measurement **M** is the sum of the true depth **D** and the random measurement error **E**. That is, :math:`M = D + E`. The measurement error **E** is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 feet and standard deviation 1.5 feet.

a. If the true depth at a certain point is 2 feet, what is the probability that the depth measurement will be negative?

b. Suppose three independent depth measurements are taken at the point where the true depth is 2 feet. What is the probability that at least one of these measurements will be negative?

.. hint:: 

    What is the complement of "*at least one*"? Refer to :ref:`square_of_opposition`!

c. What is the probability that the mean of the three independent depth measurements taken at the point where the true depth is 2 feet will be negative?
