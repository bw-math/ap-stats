?. **2021, Free Response, #5a-b** A research center conducted a national survey about teenage behavior. Teens were asked whether they had consumed a soft drink in the past week. The following table shows the counts for three independent random samples from major cities.

+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
|       | Baltimore | Detroit | San Diego | Total |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| Yes   | 727       | 1,232   | 1,482     | 3,441 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| No    | 177       | 431     | 798       | 1,406 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| Total | 904       | 1,663   | 2,280     | 4,847 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+

    a. Suppose one teen is randomly selected from each city's sample. A researcher claims that the likelihood of selecting a teen from Baltimore who consumed a soft drink in the past week is less than the likelihood of selecting a teen from either one of the other cities who consumed a soft drink in the past week because Baltimore has the least number of teens who consumed a soft drink. Is the researcher's claim correct? Explain your answer.

    b. Consider the values in the table. Construct a segmented bar chart of relative frequencies based on the information in the table. 
    
    c. Which city had the smallest proportion of teens who consumed a soft drink in the previous week? Determine the value of the proportion.


?. **2021, Free Response #6** Attendance at games for a certain baseball team is being investigated by the team owner. The following boxplots summarize the attendance, measured as average number of attendees per game, for 47 years of the team's existence. The boxplots include the 30 years of games played in the old stadium and the 17 years played in the new stadium.

    :align: center

a. Compare the distributions of average attendance between the old and new stadiums.

The following scatterplot shows average attendance versus year,

.. image:: ../../../assets/imgs/classwork/2021_apstats_frp_06b.png

b. Compare the trends in average attendance over time between the old and new stadium.

Consider the following scatterplots,

.. image:: ../../../assets/imgs/classwork/2021_apstats_frp_06c.png

c. Graph I shows the average attendance versus number of games won for each year. Describe the relationship between the variables.

d. Graph II shows the same information as Graph I, but also indicates the old and new stadiums. Does Graph II suggest that the rate at which attendance changes as number of games won increases is different in the new stadium compared to the old stadium? Explain your reasoning.

e. Consider the three variables: number of games won, year, and stadium. Based on the graphs, explain how one of those variables could be a confounding variable in the relationship between average attendance and the other variables.
