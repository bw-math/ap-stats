?. **2006, Free Response, #5** When a tractor pulls a plow through an agricultural field, the energy needed to pull that plow is called the draft. The draft is affected by environmental conditions such as soil type, terrain, and moisture. 

A study was conducted to determine whether a newly developed hitch would be able to reduce draft compared to the standard hitch. (A hitch is used to connect the plow to the tractor.) Two large plots of land were used in this study. It was randomly determined which plot was to be plowed using the standard hitch. As the tractor plowed that plot, a measurement device on the tractor automatically recorded the draft at 25 randomly selected points in the plot.

After the plot was plowed, the hitch was changed from the standard one to the new one, a process that takes a substantial amount of time. Then the second plot was plowed using the new hitch. Twenty-five measurements of draft were also recorded at randomly selected points in this plot.

    a. What was the response variable in this study?
 
    b. Identify the treatments.
 
    c. What were the experimental units?

    d. Given that the goal of the study is to determine whether a newly developed hitch reduces draft compared to the standard hitch, was randomization used properly in this study? Justify your answer.

    e. Given that the goal of the study is to determine whether a newly developed hitch reduces draft compared to the standard hitch, was replication used properly in this study? Justify your answer.

    f. Plot of land is a confounding variable in this experiment. Explain why. 

?. **2010, Free Response, #1** Agricultural experts are trying to develop a bird deterrent to reduce costly damage to crops in the United States. An experiment is to be conducted using garlic oil to study its effectiveness as a nontoxic, environmentally safe bird repellant. The experiment will use European starlings, a bird species that causes considerable damage annually to the corn crop in the United States. Food granules made from corn are to be infused with garlic oil in each of five concentrations of garlic â€”0 percent, 2 percent, 10 percent, 25 percent, and 50 percent. The researchers will determine the adverse reaction of the birds to the repellant by measuring the number of food granules consumed during a two-hour period following overnight food deprivation. There are forty birds available for the experiment, and the researchers will use eight birds for each concentration of garlic. Each bird will be kept in a separate cage and provided with the same number of food granules.

    a. For the experiment, identify: the treatments, the experimental units, the response that will be measured.

?. **2019, Free Response, #2** Researchers are investigating the effectiveness of using a fungus to control the spread of an insect that destroys trees. The researchers will create four different concentrations of fungus mixtures: 0 milliliters per liter (ml/L), 1.25 ml/L, 2.5 ml/L, and 3.75 ml/L. An equal number of the insects will be placed into 20 individual containers. The group of insects in each container will be sprayed with one of the four mixtures, and the researchers will record the number of insects that are still alive in each container one week after spraying.

    a. Identify the treatments, experimental units, and response variable of the experiment.

    b. Does the experiment have a control group? Explain your answer.

    c. Describe how the treatments can be randomly assigned to the experimental units so that each treatment has the same number of units.
