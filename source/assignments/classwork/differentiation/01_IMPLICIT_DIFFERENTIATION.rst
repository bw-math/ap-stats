1. The Normal density function, sometimes called the *Gaussian* function in honor of Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss who discovered its formula, is an important function in statistics. Graphically, the Normal density curve is a *bell curve*. Its functional form is given by,

.. math::

	\rho ( x ) = \frac{ 1 }{ sqrt{2 \cdot \pi \cdot \sigma^2} } \cdot e ^ { - \frac{ (x-\mu)^2  }{ 2 \cdot \sigma^2} }
	
The constants, :math:`\mu` and :math:`\sigma`, are *parameters* of the density function. These parameters determine the shape and curvature of the bell curve. They are *known* quantities; in other words, they may be held constant and treated as numbers. Use the Normal density function to answer the following questions.


a. Find :math:`\frac{d}{dx}(\rho (x) )`


b. Find :math:`\frac{d^2}{{dx}^2}(\rho (x))`


c. Find the value of :math:`x` where :math:`\frac{d}{dx}(\rho (x) ) = 0`


d. Find the **values** of :math:`x` where :math:`\frac{d^2}{{dx}^2}(\rho (x)) = 0`


e. Suppose :math:`\mu=10` and :math:`\sigma=2`. Use a graphing utility to plot the Normal density function. Draw vertical lines at the values of :math:`x` found in *part c* and *part d*. 

f. Describe what is happening to the tangent line at each point on the curve labelled in *part e*.
