Let f be a function that is continuous on the interval :math:`[0, 4)` . The function f is twice differentiable except at :math:`x = 2`. The function f and its derivatives have the properties indicated in the table above, where DNE indicates that the derivatives of f do not exist at x = 2.

a. For :math:`0 < x < 4`, find all values of x at which f has a relative extremum. Determine whether f has a relative maximum or a relative minimum at each of these values. Justify your answer.

b. Sketch the graph of a function that has all the characteristics of f .
