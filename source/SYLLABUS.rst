.. admonition:: Instructor Information

AP Statistics is an introductory college-level statistics course that introduces students to the major concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Students cultivate their understanding of statistics using technology, investigations, problem solving, and writing as they explore concepts like variation and distribution; patterns and uncertainty; and data-based predictions, decisions, and conclusions.

.. topic:: Overview 

    Most classes will be broken into a lecture portion and a classwork portion. The classwork will pertain to the lecture just given. Classwork will often involve a combination of hand written work, results collected from calculator and computer program output, and visual aids, such as news programs and articles that involve applications of statistics.

    At the end of each class, reading from the textbook will be assigned. The student is expected to complete the reading by next class. 

    Each week, homework from the textbook and other sources will be assigned. Homework will be collected every Monday.

    Each week, a project will be assigned that involves creating and interpretting statistical graphs, performing analysis on real-life data sets, simulating outcomes using random numbers or other applications. Usually, projects will be covered in detail on Friday classes; the student will have time in class on Friday to begin the project and then it will be due the following Monday. Projects will be uploaded to the Google Classroom Assignments tab.

.. topic:: Text

    Reading will be assigned from `The Practice of Statistics (for the AP Exam) <https://www.bfwpub.com/high-school/us/product/The-Practice-of-Statistics/p/1319113338>`_ by Daren S. Starnes and Josh Tabor (ISBN: 9781319113339), 6 :sup:`th` edition. This textbook will distributed to students on the first day of class. It expected the students will bring the textbook to class every day. Most, but not all (see next paragraph), reading and homework be will assigned from this textbook.

    Several units of this text will be supplemented with chapters from an online textbook library, `OpenStax <https://openstax.org>`_. We be using the `Contemporary Mathematics textbook <https://openstax.org/details/books/contemporary-mathematics>`_ and the `Introductory Statistics textbook <https://openstax.org/details/books/introductory-statistics>`_ at several points in the class. Reading and homework will be assigned from these textbooks at various points in the class.
    
    We will be using **Chapter 1: Set Theory** and **Chapter 7: Probability** from the `Contemporary Mathematics textbook <https://openstax.org/details/books/contemporary-mathematics>`_ when we cover **Unit 4** from the *Starnes & Tabor* textbook.
    
    We will be using **Chapter 6: Normal Distribution** and **Chapter 7: The Central Limit Theorem** from the `Introductory Statistics textbook <https://openstax.org/books/introductory-statistics>`_ when we cover **Unit 5** from the *Starnes & Tabor* textbook.

    We will be using **Chapter 8: Confidence Intervals** from `Introductory Statistics <https://openstax.org/books/introductory-statistics>`_ when we cover **Unit 6** and **Unit 7** from the *Starnes & Tabor* textbook.

    The online :ref:`class_notes` will also serve as reference material for many of the subjects discussed in class.

.. topic:: Technology 

    TI-84
        The student is expected to bring a calculator from the `TI-84 series <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84_Plus_series>`_ of calculators to class every day. It is important the calculator is a *TI-84* and not one of the older *TI-83*. `TI Connect CE <https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw>`_ will be used to transmit datasets to students during class. This software will only integrate with calculators from the *TI-84* series.

    ChromeBook
        The student is expected to bring the ChromeBook they have been provided to class every day. It should be fully-charged. The student will need this to access online resources such as projects and datasets.

    Python 3
        Students will be shown how to install `Python3 <https://python.org>`_ on their ChromeBooks very early in the class schedule. **Python 3** will be used to perform data analysis and generate graphical representations of data. Statistical graphs will be generated using `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_.

        All :ref:`projects` and some class work will be done **Python 3**. In each case, the student will write programs that perform statistical analysis and interpret the results.  

.. topic:: Google Classroom

    Any and all announcements will be posted to the Google Classroom. Any assignments or projects that are completed on the student's ChromeBook will be uploaded to Google as zip files. The code to join the classroom is given below,

    Classroom Code
        Will be distributed on the first class date.

.. topic:: Website

    All of the class notes, classwork, homework and projects for this class can be found at `https://bishopwalshmath.org/ <https://bishopwalshmath.org/>`_. This site includes references to additional resources, such as datasets used in class, tutorial videos and links to relevant Python documentation.

    **NOTE**: I will probably change the address to "*https://apstats.bishopwalshmath.org*" once I have everything setup.

.. topic:: Quizzes

    Quizzes will be of the *pop* variety, meaning they will not be announced ahead of time. Quizzes will typically be short, five to ten minutes assessments aimed at verifying reading selections have been read by the student before class begins.

.. topic:: Classwork

    Classwork will come a variety of sources:

    - The student will complete exercises in the *Bluman* textbook.
    - The student will complete exercises designed to assess learning outcomes.
    - The student will complete exercises from the :ref:`classwork` section. 
    - The student will complete sample problems from `previous A.P. exams <https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-statistics/exam/past-exam-questions>`_

    Classwork Notebook

        On the first day of class, student will receive a classwork notebook. This notebook will never leave the classroom. It will be collected at the end of every class and graded.

.. topic:: Homework

    Homework will come from a variety of sources:
    
    - The student will complete exercises in the *Bluman* textbook.
    - The student will complete exercises designed to assess learning outcomes.
    - The student will complete sample problems from `previous A.P. exams <https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-statistics/exam/past-exam-questions>`_
 
    Homework Notebook

        On the first day of class, students will receive a homework notebook. This notebook will be taken home with you. **All** homework should be completed in this notebook. It will be collected every Monday and returned the next day, with the exception of exam days. See below for more information.

    Regular Homework

        Homework will be assigned every week. The student is expected to work on it throughout the week. It will be collected every Monday. 

    Review Homework

        On exam weeks, review homework will be assigned. This homework will be due the day of the exam.

.. topic:: Class Notebook

    The student is expected to bring their own notebook to take notes during class. This notebook is **separate** from the classwork notebook and homework notebook; it belongs to the student and will not be collected for grading.

    While students will use their ChromeBooks extensively in class to perform data analysis, when these activities are not being done, it is expected the ChromeBook will be closed and all note-taking will occur in the student's notebook. 

.. topic:: Projects

    The student will complete projects using their ChromeBook and **Python 3**. The projects will involve performing analysis on data sets, visualizing results and interpretting the output.

    Projects will include either one or several *.csv* files and a *.py* script file. The *.py* file will contain a **Python 3** program written by the student that addresses and answers all assigned exercises. Written responses will be included in comments in the script files.

    Projects will be zipped into zip files and uploaded to Google. 
    
    The student will be shown how to do all of this in class before the first project is assigned.
