This course is designed to build on the algebraic and geometric concepts learned in *Algebra 1*. It develops advanced algebra skills such as systems of equations, quadratics, polynomials, imaginary and complex numbers, conics and trigonometry. The content of this course is very important for a student's success on both the *ACT* and *SAT*. It will also help prepare the student for future college courses or career choices.
