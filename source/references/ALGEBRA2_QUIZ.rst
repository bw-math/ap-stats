Order of Operations
*******************

1. Simplify the following arithmetical expression:


.. math::

    \frac{(3*2^3-4)}{(2 \cdot 6 - 8)}


2. Simplify the following arithmetical expression:

.. math::

    3 \cdot ( 3 \cdot x + 5) - 2 \cdot (2 \cdot x - 3)

Algebraic Expressions
*********************

3. Fill out the following table for the algebraic expression :math:`y = 2 \cdot x + 3` by substituting in the given value of x. After you fill out the table, plot the *ordered pairs* :math:`(x, y)` on the graph below. 

+--------+--------------------------+
|    x   |  :math:`y = 2 \cdot x+3` |
+--------+--------------------------+
|    0   |                          |
+--------+--------------------------+
|    1   |                          |

Linear Equations
****************

For the next two problems you are given an equation of a line, :math:`y = m \cdot x + b`.

4. :math:`y = 3 \cdot x - 2`

a. What is the slope of this line?



b. What is the y-intercept of this line?

.. hint::

    The y-intercept is a *point* :math:`(x, y)`. What are the values of :math:`x` and `y` at the *y-intercept*?



c. Plot this line on the graph below,

.. image:: ../assets/imgs/context/cartesian_plane.png
    :align: center



d. Label the y-intercept with the letter **P** on your graph.



5. :math:`y = -2 \cdot x + 3`

a. What is the slope of this line?



b. What is the y-intercept of this line?

.. hint::

    See hint in #4.



c. Plot this line on the graph below,

.. image:: ../assets/imgs/context/cartesian_plane.png
    :align: center



d. Label the y-intercept with the letter **P** on your graph.



Distributive Property
*********************

6. Multiply and combine like terms:

.. math::

    (x + 3) \cdot (x - 5)




7. Multiply and combine like terms:

.. math::

    (2 \cdot x + 3) \cdot ( 5\cdot x + 1 )




Factor By Grouping
******************

8. Factor the following algebraic expression by grouping the terms together,

.. math::

    x^2 - 5 \cdot x - 2 \cdot x + 10




9. Factor the following algebraic expression by grouping the terms together,

.. math::

    y^2 - 6 \cdot y + 2 \cdot y - 12
