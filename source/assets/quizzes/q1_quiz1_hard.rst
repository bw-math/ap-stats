A research center conducted a national survey about teenage behavior. Teens were asked whether they had consumed a soft drink in the past week. The following table shows the counts for three independent random samples from major cities.

+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
|       | Baltimore | Detroit | San Diego | Total |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| Yes   | 727       | 1,232   | 1,482     | 3,441 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| No    | 177       | 431     | 798       | 1,406 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| Total | 904       | 1,663   | 2,280     | 4,847 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+

    a. Suppose one teen is randomly selected from each city's sample. A researcher claims that the likelihood of selecting a teen from Baltimore who consumed a soft drink in the past week is less than the likelihood of selecting a teen from either one of the other cities who consumed a soft drink in the past week because Baltimore has the least number of teens who consumed a soft drink. Is the researcher's claim correct? Explain your answer.
    
    b. Which city had the smallest proportion of teens who consumed a soft drink in the previous week? Determine the value of the proportion.

Hurricane damage amounts, in millions of dollars per acre, were estimated from insurance records for major hurricanes for the past three decades. A stratified random sample of five locations (based on categories of distance from the coast) was selected from each of three coastal regions in the southeastern United States. The three regions were Gulf Coast (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi), Florida, and Lower Atlantic (Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina). Damage amounts in millions of dollars per acre, adjusted for inflation, are shown in the table below. The top row of this table represents the distance from the coast.

**Hurricane Damage Amounts In Millions of Dollars Per Acre**

+----------------+----------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------+
|                | < 1 mile | 1 to 2 miles | 2 to 5 miles | 5 to 10 miles | 10 to 20 miles |
+----------------+----------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------+
| Gulf Coast     | 24.7     | 21.0         | 12.0         | 7.3           | 1.7            |
+----------------+----------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------+
| Florida        | 35.1     | 31.7         | 20.7         | 6.4           | 3.0            |
+----------------+----------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------+
| Lower Atlantic | 21.8     | 15.7         | 12.6         | 1.2           | 0.3            |
+----------------+----------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------+


Describe differences and similarities in the hurricane damage amounts among the three regions in a few sentences. Justify your answers with calculations.
