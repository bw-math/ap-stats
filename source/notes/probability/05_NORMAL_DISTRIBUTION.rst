TODO 

Varying the Standard Deviation
------------------------------

By changing the :ref:`standard_deviation`, the shape of the distribution changes. As the :ref:`standard_deviation` increase, the graph spreads out. This is because :ref:`standard_deviation` is a :ref:`measure of variation<measures_of_variation>`. In other words, :ref:`standard_deviation` quantifies how the distribution is spread out along the *x*-axis.

To summarize,

.. note:: 
    1. By changing the mean of the *normal distribution*, the *location* of the distribution changes.
    2. By changing the standard deviation of the *normal distribution*, the *spread* of the distribution changes.
