A Brief History of Knowledge

Knowing Knowledge
=================

How do we know things? To put a finer point on it, how do we know *that* we know things? What exactly does *knowing a thing* entail? 

    **Socrates**: Have you heard what they say nowadays that knowing is?

    **Theatetus**: Perhaps; however, I do not remember just at this moment.

    **Socrates**: They say it is having knowledge.

    **Theatetus**: True.

    **Socrates**: Let us make a slight change and say possessing knowledge.

    **Theatetus**: Why, how will you claIm that the one differs from the other?

    **Socrates**: Well, then, having does not seem to me the same as possessing. For instance, if a man bought a cloak and had it under his control, but did not wear it, we should certainly not say that he had it, but that possessed it.

    **Theatetus**: And rightly.

    **Socrates**: Now see whether it is possible in the same way for one who possesses knowledge not to have it, as, for instance, if a man should catch wild birds--pigeons or the like--and should arrange an aviary at home and keep them in it, we might in a way assert that he always has them because he possesses them, might we not?

    **Theatetus**: Yes.

    **Socrates**: And yet in another way that he has none of them, but that he has acquired power over them, since he has brougth them under his control in his own enclosure, to take them and hold them whenever he likes, by catching whichever bird he pleases, and to let them go again; and he can do this as often as he pleases.

This transcription of a dialogue that allegedly transpired between Socrates and a young student of his named Theatetus sometime in the 4 :sup:`th` century BCE comes down to us through Plato. The contents of Plato's *Theatetus* have greatly influenced the development of scientific thought in the subsequent centuries, so it is worth understanding why Plato thought what Socrates was saying was so important it should be written down for future generations. 

Socrates is making the point in the preceding lines that knowledge is not something you *have*, but something you *possess*.
