These are scripts will go over in class to illustrate key ideas from statistics. 

Conditional Distributions
-------------------------

This script will generate a random bivariate sample of categorical data and then construct a conditional distribution for one variable. A stacked bar chart is then created to visualize the association, or lack thereof, between the two conditional distributions.

Estimators
----------

This script contains many useful functions for young statisticians seeking to tame the wild beast of uncertainy.

The Effect of Outliers
----------------------

This script generates a distribution of grades and visualizes the distribution with a dot plot. It will then calculate the sample mean and sample median, and plot as vertical lines, red and green respectively. 

We will alter the distribution in class to see how it affects the sample mean and median.

Die Roll Simulation
-------------------

This script will simulate rolling ``m`` die ``n`` times. The outcome of the ``m`` die rolls is then summed and a frequency distribution is created for the ``n`` experiments. The frequency distribution is visualized with a histogram. 

The intent is show how the random variation of :ref:`independent <independence>`, identically distributed :ref:`random variables <random_variables>` leads naturally to the normal distribution. This result is known as :ref:`central_limit_theorem`

Normal Distribution
-------------------

This script shows how to work with the normal distribution in **Python**. It demonstrates how to calculate percentiles and probabilities. It also demonstrates how the symmetry of the :ref:`normal_distribution` manifests numerically via the :ref:`law_of_complements`.
