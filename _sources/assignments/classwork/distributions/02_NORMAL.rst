Normal Distribution
===================

1. Sketch a Standard Normal distribution in the x-y plane. Shade in the areas indicated in the problems below. Label the axes. Label each area with the percentage of the distribution that corresponds to the shaded region. Use a :ref:`z_table` to find the exact percentage.

a. :math:`P(Z \leq -1.62)`

b. :math:`P(Z \geq 1.62)`

c. :math:`P(Z \leq -1.96)`

d. :math:`P(Z \geq 1.96)`

e. What is the relationship between parts *a* and *b*, and parts *c* and *d*? What characteristic of the Standard Normal distribution is being shown here? 

2. Sketch a Standard Normal distribution in the x-y plane. Shade in the areas indicated in the problems below. Label the axes. Label each area with the percentage of the distribution that corresponds to the shaded region. Use a :ref:`z_table` to find the exact percentage.

a. :math:`P(-1.5 \leq Z \leq 1.5)`

b. :math:`P(-1.5 \leq Z \leq 0)`

c. :math:`P(0 \leq Z \leq 1.5)`

d. What is the relationship between parts *a*, *b* and *c*? Explain the result graphically. 

3. Sketch a Standard Normal distribution in the x-y plane. Find the values of Z which correspond to the areas given below. Shade in the areas and label the axes with the value found. Use a :ref:`z_table` to solve the problem.

a. 0.90

b. 0.75

c. 0.5 

d. 0.25

e. 0.10

Men's shirt sizes are determined by their neck sizes. Suppose that men's neck sizes are approximately normally distributed with mean 15.7 inches and standard deviation 0.7 inch. A retailer sells men's shirts in sizes S, M, L, XL, where the shirt sizes are defined in the table below.

    :align: center

a. Because the retailer only stocks the sizes listed above, what proportion of customers will find that the retailer does not carry any shirts in their sizes? Show your work.

b. Using a sketch of a normal curve, illustrate the proportion of men whose shirt size is M. Calculate this proportion.

c. Of 12 randomly selected customers, what is the probability that exactly 4 will request size M ? Show your work.
