    Start a fresh page in your classwork notebook. Write today's date in the margin of the page. Clearly label and solve each of the following. Show your work and circle the anwer. 

Electric Vehicle Distribution
=============================

The United States Government General Services Administration maintains a huge database of public available information. One of the datasets they publish is the "`Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data>`"

A random sample of 20 eletric vehicles was selected from this dataset and the *make* of the car was recorded. The resuls are given below,

    BMW, FORD, CHEVROLEY, TESLA, FORD, BMW, VOLVO, TESLA, TESLA, NISSAN, CHEVROLET, BMW, TESLA, NISSAN, CHEVROLET, TESLA, TESLA, CHEVROLET


1. What is the population being sampled in this experiment?
   
2. Construct a relative frequency distribution and histogram for this sample of data. Label the axes. What is the most common (frequent) electric vehicle in this sample of data?

3. Based on this sample, can we conclude your answer to #1 is the most common vehicle in the United States? Why or why not? 


.. note:: 

    We will come back and examine this data set again.

Twitter by Tweets and Followers
===============================

.. important:: 

    The data will be downloaded directly onto the your calculator in class via a cable link. 

    If you want to try out the dataset in **Python** at any point, you can download the full dataset `here <../../assets/datasets/celebrity_twitter_data.csv>`_

The following table lists the top 20 **Twitter** users by follower count (as of 2022).

A research center conducted a national survey about teenage behavior. Teens were asked whether they had consumed a soft drink in the past week. The following table shows the counts for three independent random samples from major cities.

+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
|       | Baltimore | Detroit | San Diego | Total |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| Yes   | 727       | 1,232   | 1,482     | 3,441 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| No    | 177       | 431     | 798       | 1,406 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| Total | 904       | 1,663   | 2,280     | 4,847 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+

    a. Suppose one teen is randomly selected from each city's sample. A researcher claims that the likelihood of selecting a teen from Baltimore who consumed a soft drink in the past week is less than the likelihood of selecting a teen from either one of the other cities who consumed a soft drink in the past week because Baltimore has the least number of teens who consumed a soft drink. Is the researcher's claim correct? Explain your answer.

    b. Consider the values in the table. Construct a segmented bar chart of relative frequencies based on the information in the table. 
    
    c. Which city had the smallest proportion of teens who consumed a soft drink in the previous week? Determine the value of the proportion.

Attendance at games for a certain baseball team is being investigated by the team owner. The following boxplots summarize the attendance, measured as average number of attendees per game, for 47 years of the team's existence. The boxplots include the 30 years of games played in the old stadium and the 17 years played in the new stadium.

.. image:: ../../../assets/imgs/classwork/2021_apstats_frp_06a.png
    :align: center

Use this graph to answer the following question,

    a. Compare the distributions of average attendance between the old and new stadiums.

The following scatterplot shows average attendance versus year,

.. image:: ../../../assets/imgs/classwork/2021_apstats_frp_06b.png
    :align: center

Use this graph to answer the following question,

    b. Compare the trends in average attendance over time between the old and new stadium.

Consider the following scatterplots,

.. image:: ../../../assets/imgs/classwork/2021_apstats_frp_06c.png
    :align: center

Use these graphs to answer the following questions,

    c. Graph I shows the average attendance versus number of games won for each year. Describe the relationship between the variables.

    d. Graph II shows the same information as Graph I, but also indicates the old and new stadiums. Does Graph II suggest that the rate at which attendance changes as number of games won increases is different in the new stadium compared to the old stadium? Explain your reasoning.

    e. Consider the three variables: number of games won, year, and stadium. Based on the graphs, explain how one of those variables could be a confounding variable in the relationship between average attendance and the other variables.

The following histograms summarize the teaching year for the teachers at two high schools, A and B.

.. image:: ../../../assets/imgs/classwork/2018_apstats_frp_05.png
    :align: center

Teaching year is recorded as an integer, with first-year teachers recorded as 1, second-year teachers recorded as 2, and so on. Both sets of data have a mean teaching year of 8.2, with data recorded from 200 teachers at High School A and 221 teachers at High School B. On the histograms, each interval represents possible integer values from the left endpoint up to but not including the right endpoint.

    a. The median teaching year for one high school is 6, and the median teaching year for the other high school is 7. Identify which high school has each median and justify your answer.

    b. An additional 18 teachers were not included with the data recorded from the 200 teachers at High School A. The mean teaching year of the 18 teachers is 2.5. What is the mean teaching year for all 218 teachers at High School A?

The chemicals in clay used to make pottery can differ depending on the geographical region where the clay originated. Sometimes, archaeologists use a chemical analysis of clay to help identify where a piece of pottery originated. Such an analysis measures the amount of a chemical in the clay as a percent of the total weight of the piece of pottery. The boxplots below summarize analyses done for three chemicals—X, Y, and Z—on pieces of pottery that originated at one of three sites: I, II, or III.

.. image:: ../../../assets/imgs/classwork/2017_apstats_frp_04.png

Use this information to answer the following questions.

    a. For chemical Z, describe how the percents found in the pieces of pottery are similar and how they differ among the three sites.

    b. Consider a piece of pottery known to have originated at one of the three sites, but the actual site is not known.

        i. Suppose an analysis of the clay reveals that the sum of the percents of the three chemicals X, Y, and Z is 20.5%. Based on the boxplots, which site—I, II, or III—is the most likely site where the piece of pottery originated? Justify your choice.

        ii. Suppose only one chemical could be analyzed in the piece of pottery. Which chemical—X, Y, or Z— would be the most useful in identifying the site where the piece of pottery originated? Justify your choice.
