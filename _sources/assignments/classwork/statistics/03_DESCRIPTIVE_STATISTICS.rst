    :align: center

a. Based on the histogram, write a few sentences describing the distribution of room size in the residence hall.

b. Summary statistics for the sizes are given in the following table.

    :align: center

Determine whether there are potential outliers in the data. Then use the following grid to sketch a boxplot of room size.

c. What characteristic of the shape of the distribution of room size is apparent from the histogram but not from the boxplot?

Which of the following is the median number of siblings for these 25 students?

    (A) 1

    (B) 1.5

    (C) 2

a. Write a few sentences to describe the distribution of tip amounts for the day shown.

b. One of the tip amounts was $8. If the $8 tip had been $18, what effect would the increase have had on the following statistics? Justify your answers.

    The mean:

Two parents have each built a toy catapult for use in a game at an elementary school fair. To play the game, students will attempt to launch Ping-Pong balls from the catapults so that the balls land within a 5-centimeter band. A target line will be drawn through the middle of the band, as shown in the figure below. All points on the target line are equidistant from the launching location.

    :align: center

If a ball lands within the shaded band, the student will win a prize. The parents have constructed the two catapults according to slightly different plans. They want to test these
catapults before building additional ones. Under identical conditions, the parents launch 40 Ping-Pong balls from each catapult and measure the distance that the ball travels before landing. Distances to the nearest centimeter are graphed in the dotplots below.

.. image:: ../../../assets/imgs/classwork/2006_apstats_frp_1b.png
    :align: center

a. Comment on any similarities and any differences in the two distributions of distances traveled by balls launched from catapult A and catapult B.

b. If the parents want to maximize the percentage of having the Ping-Pong balls land within the band, which one of the two catapults, A or B, would be better to use than the other? Justify your choice.

c. Using the catapult that you chose in part *b*, how many centimeters from the target line should this catapult be placed? Explain why you chose this distance.

Since Hill Valley High School eliminated the use of bells between classes, teachers have noticed that more
students seem to be arriving to class a few minutes late. One teacher decided to collect data to determine whether
the students’ and teachers’ watches are displaying the correct time. At exactly 12:00 noon, the teacher asked
9 randomly selected students and 9 randomly selected teachers to record the times on their watches to the nearest
half minute. The ordered data showing minutes after 12:00 as positive values and minutes before 12:00 as
negative values are shown in the table below.


+----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+
| Students | -4.5 | -3.0 | -0.5 | 0    | 0    | 0.5  | 0.5 | 1.5 | 5.0 |
+----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+
| Teachers | -2.0 | -1.5 | -1.5 | -1.0 | -1.0 | -0.5 | 0   | 0   | 0.5 |
+----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+

a. Construct parallel boxplots using these data.

b. Based on the boxplots in part *#a*, which of the two groups, students or teachers, tends to have watch times that are closer to the true time? Explain your choice.

A large regional real estate company keeps records of home sales for each of its sales agents. Each month, the company publishes the sales volume for each agent. Monthly sales volume is defined as the total sales price of all homes sold by the agent during a month. The figure below displays the cumulative relative frequency plot of the most recent monthly sales volume (in hundreds of thousands of dollars) for these agents.

.. image:: ../../../assets/imgs/classwork/2016_apstats_frp_formb_01.png
	:align: center
	
a. In the context of this question, explain what information is conveyed by the circled point.

b. What proportion of sales agents achieved monthly sales volumes between $700,000 and $800,000 ?

c. For values between 10 and 11 on the horizontal axis, the cumulative relative frequency plot is flat. In the context of this question, explain what this means.

d. A bonus is to be given to 20 percent of the sales agents. Those who achieved the highest monthly sales volume during the preceding month will receive a bonus. What is the minimum monthly sales volume an agent must have achieved to qualify for the bonus?
