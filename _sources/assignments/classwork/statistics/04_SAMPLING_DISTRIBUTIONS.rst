Schools in a certain state receive funding based on the number of students who attend the school. To determine the number of students who attend a school, one school day is selected at random and the number of students in attendance that day is counted and used for funding purposes. The daily number of absences at High School A in the state is approximately normally distributed with mean of 120 students and Standard deviation of 10.5 students.

a. If more than 140 students are absent on the day the attendance count is taken for funding purposes, the school will lose some of its state funding in the subsequent year. Approximately what is the probability that High School A will lose some state funding?

b. The principals' association in the state suggests that instead of choosing one day at random, the state should choose 3 days at random. With the suggested plan, High School A would lose some of its state funding in the subsequent year if the mean number of students absent for the 3 days is greater than 140. Would High School A be more likely, less likely, or equally likely to lose funding using the suggested plan compared to the plan described in part *a*? Justify your choice.

c. A typical school week consists of the days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The principal at High School A believes that the number of absences tends to be greater on Mondays and Fridays, and there is concern that the school will lose state funding if the attendance count occurs on a Monday or Friday. If one school day is chosen at random from each of 3 typical school weeks, what is the probability that none of the 3 days chosen is a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday?

The depth from the surface of Earth to a refracting layer beneath the surface can be estimated using methods developed by seismologists. One method is based on the time required for vibrations to travel from a distant explosion to a receiving point. The depth measurement **M** is the sum of the true depth **D** and the random measurement error **E**. That is, :math:`M = D + E`. The measurement error **E** is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 feet and standard deviation 1.5 feet.

a. If the true depth at a certain point is 2 feet, what is the probability that the depth measurement will be negative?

b. Suppose three independent depth measurements are taken at the point where the true depth is 2 feet. What is the probability that at least one of these measurements will be negative?

.. hint:: 

    What is the complement of "*at least one*"? Refer to :ref:`square_of_opposition`!

c. What is the probability that the mean of the three independent depth measurements taken at the point where the true depth is 2 feet will be negative?
