The developers of a training program designed to improve manual dexterity claim that people who complete the 6-week program will increase their manual dexterity. A random sample of 12 people enrolled in the training program was selected. A measure of each personâ€™s dexterity on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 9 (highest) was recorded just before the start of and just after the completion of the 6-week program. The data are shown in the table below.
