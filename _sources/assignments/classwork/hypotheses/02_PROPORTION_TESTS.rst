A random sample of 200 students was selected from a large college in the United States. Each selected student was asked to give his or her opinion about the following statement.

    “The most important quality of a person who aspires to be the President of the United States is a knowledge of foreign affairs.”

Each response was recorded in one of five categories. The gender of each selected student was noted. The data are summarized in the table below.
