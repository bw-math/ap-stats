Implicit Differentiation
========================

1. Use implicit differentiation to find :math:`\frac{dy}{dx}` for each of the following,

a. 

b.

c.

d.

e.

2. **Natural Log Derivative**

The formula for the derivative of the natural log, :math:`ln(x)`, can be derived with *implicit differentiation*. To do so, recall the differentiaion rule for exponential functions,

.. topic:: Exponential Derivative

	.. math::
	
		\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x
		
Then define *y* as,

.. math::

	y = \ln(x)
	
Use *implicit differentiation* to derive the formula for,

.. math::
	
	\frac{d}{dx}(ln(x)) = \frac{1}{x}
	
.. hint::
	
	Solve for :math:`x` and then apply the *Chain Rule*.
	
3. **Inverse Trigonometric Derivatives**

In class we used *implicit differentiation* to derive, 

.. math::

	\frac{d}{dx}( \arcsin(x) ) = \frac{1}{sqrt{1-x^2}}
	
Using a similar process, find the derivatives of the following inverse trigonometric functions,

a. :math:`f(x) = \arccos(x)`

b. :math:`f(x) = \arctan(x)`

.. hint::

	Remember to draw a diagram of the unit circle. Express *x* and *y* in terms of lengths and angles!
