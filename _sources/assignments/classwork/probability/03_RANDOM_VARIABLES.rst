1. A random variable **X** is defined as the sum of two six-sided die rolls. 

    - List the sample space for this random variable.
    - Find the probability distribution :math:`P(X=x)` for all values of *x*.

A company that manufactures smartphones developed a new battery that has a longer life span than that of a traditional battery. From the date of purchase of a smartphone, the distribution of the life span of the new battery is approximately normal with mean 30 months and standard deviation 8 months. For the price of $50, the company offers a two-year warranty on the new battery for customers who purchase a smartphone. The warranty guarantees that the smartphone will be replaced at no cost to the customer if the battery no longer works within 24 months from the date of purchase.

a. In how many months from the date of purchase is it expected that 25 percent of the batteries will no longer work? Justify your answer.

b. Suppose one customer who purchases the warranty is selected at random. What is the probability that the customer selected will require a replacement within 24 months from the date of purchase because the battery no longer works?

c. The company has a gain of $50 for each customer who purchases a warranty but does not require a replacement. The company has a loss (negative gain) of $150 for each customer who purchases a warranty and does require a replacement. What is the expected value of the gain for the company for each warranty purchased?

A shopping mall has three automated teller machines (ATMs). Because the machines receive heavy use, they sometimes stop working and need to be repaired. Let the random variable X represent the number of ATMs that are working when the mall opens on a randomly selected day. The table shows the probability distribution of X. Number of ATMs working when

a. What is the probability that at least one ATM is working when the mall opens?

b. What is the expected value of the number of ATMs that are working when the mall opens?

c. What is the probability that all three ATMs are working when the mall opens, given that at least one ATM is working?

d. Given that at least one ATM is working when the mall opens, would the expected value of the number of ATMs that are working be less than, equal to, or greater than the expected value from part *b*? Explain.

Schools in a certain state receive funding based on the number of students who attend the school. To determine the number of students who attend a school, one school day is selected at random and the number of students in attendance that day is counted and used for funding purposes. The daily number of absences at High School A in the state is approximately normally distributed with mean of 120 students and
standard deviation of 10.5 students.

a. If more than 140 students are absent on the day the attendance count is taken for funding purposes, the school will lose some of its state funding in the subsequent year. Approximately what is the probability that High School A will lose some state funding?

b. The principalsâ€™ association in the state suggests that instead of choosing one day at random, the state should choose 3 days at random. With the suggested plan, High School A would lose some of its state funding in the subsequent year if the mean number of students absent for the 3 days is greater than 140. Would High School A be more likely, less likely, or equally likely to lose funding using the suggested plan compared to the plan described in *part a*? Justify your choice.

c. A typical school week consists of the days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The principal at High School A believes that the number of absences tends to be greater on Mondays and Fridays, and there is concern that the school will lose state funding if the attendance count occurs on a Monday or Friday. If one school day is chosen at random from each of 3 typical school weeks, what is the probability that none of the 3 days chosen is a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday?
