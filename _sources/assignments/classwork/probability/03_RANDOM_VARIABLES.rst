1. A random variable **X** is defined as the sum of two six-sided die rolls. 

    - List the sample space for this random variable.
    - Find the probability distribution :math:`P(X=x)` for all values of *x*.

A shopping mall has three automated teller machines (ATMs). Because the machines receive heavy use, they sometimes stop working and need to be repaired. Let the random variable X represent the number of ATMs that are working when the mall opens on a randomly selected day. The table shows the probability distribution of X. Number of ATMs working when

a. What is the probability that at least one ATM is working when the mall opens?

b. What is the expected value of the number of ATMs that are working when the mall opens?

c. What is the probability that all three ATMs are working when the mall opens, given that at least one ATM is working?

d. Given that at least one ATM is working when the mall opens, would the expected value of the number of ATMs that are working be less than, equal to, or greater than the expected value from part *b*? Explain.

Nine sales representatives, 6 men and 3 women, at a small company wanted to attend a national convention. There were only enough travel funds to send 3 people. The manager selected 3 people to attend and stated that the people were selected at random. The 3 people selected were women. There were concerns that no men were selected to attend the convention.

a. Calculate the probability that randomly selecting 3 people from a group of 6 men and 3 women will result in selecting 3 women.

b. Based on your answer to part *a*, is there reason to doubt the manager's claim that the 3 people were selected at random? Explain.

c. An alternative to calculating the exact probability is to conduct a simulation to estimate the probability. A proposed simulation process is described below.

.. topic:: Proposed Simulation

    Each trial in the simulation consists of rolling three fair, six-sided dice, one die for each of the convention attendees. For each die, rolling a 1, 2, 3, or 4 represents selecting a man; rolling a 5 or 6 represents selecting a woman. After 1,000 trials, the number of times the dice indicate selecting 3 women is recorded.

Does the proposed process correctly simulate the random selection of 3 women from a group of 9 people consisting of 6 men and 3 women? Explain why or why not.

A company manufactures model rockets that require igniters to launch. Once an igniter is used to launch a rocket, the igniter cannot be reused. Sometimes an igniter fails to operate correctly, and the rocket does not launch. The company estimates that the overall failure rate, defined as the percent of all igniters that fail to operate correctly, is 15 percent.

A company engineer develops a new igniter, called the super igniter, with the intent of lowering the failure rate.

To test the performance of the super igniters, the engineer uses the following process.

    Step 1: One super igniter is selected at random and used in a rocket.
    Step 2: If the rocket launches, another super igniter is selected at random and used in a rocket.

Step 2 is repeated until the process stops. The process stops when a super igniter fails to operate correctly or 32 super igniters have successfully launched rockets, whichever comes first. Assume that super igniter failures are independent.

a. If the failure rate of the super igniters is 15 percent, what is the probability that the first 30 super igniters selected using the testing process successfully launch rockets?

b. Given that the first 30 super igniters successfully launch rockets, what is the probability that the first failure occurs on the thirty-first or the thirty-second super igniter tested if the failure rate of the super igniters is 15 percent?

c. Given that the first 30 super igniters successfully launch rockets, is it reasonable to believe that the failure rate of the super igniters is less than 15 percent? Explain.
