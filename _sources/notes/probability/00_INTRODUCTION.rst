Introduction
============

Probability is the study of the properties of random events.

Preliminaries
-------------

Extended Union 
    A symbol that represents the union of a sequence of sets.

    .. math:: 
        \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n} A_{i} = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_{n-1} \cup A_n 

Summation
    A symbol that represents the sum of the elements :sub:`i`\ *x*

    .. math::
        \sum_{i=0}^n x_i = x_1 + x_2 + ... x_{n-1} + x_n

Definitions

Terms
    Experiment
        An *uncertain* event.
    Mutual Exclusivity
        Two sets, **A** and **B**, are *mutually exclusive* if they are disjoint.
        
        :math:`A \cap B = \varnothing \implies` A and B are mutually exclusive.
