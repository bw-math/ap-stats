In this project, you will perform some graphical analysis on a famously biased data set. 

Background
==========

In the years 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, the Selective Service System in the United States held a draft lottery by order of Lyndon B. Johnson for men born between the dates of January 1, 1944 and December 31, 1950 [DRAFT]_.

Individuals born between these dates were to be selected at random and drafted into military service.

Method of Observation
---------------------

The method used to select individuals for service is highly controversial. Many argued it was not truly random and unfairly selected certain groups of individuals over others. 

365 days of the year were printed on sheets of paper and placed in a shoebox.

    { January 1, January 2, ... , Feburary 1, February 2, ... , December 30, December 31 }

Slips of paper were then selected at random and anyone of eligible age who had a birthday on the date indicated would be drafted. The important point is *individuals who shared the same birthday* would be drafted at the same time. As example, two men who had the birthdays April 5 :sup:`th`, 1946 and April 5:sup:`th`, 1947 would both be drafted in the event a slip of paper *"April 5"* was selected.
