AP Statistics is an introductory college-level statistics course that introduces students to the major concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Students cultivate their understanding of statistics using technology, investigations, problem solving, and writing as they explore concepts like variation and distribution; patterns and uncertainty; and data-based predictions, decisions, and conclusions.

.. topic:: Overview 

    Most classes will be broken into a lecture portion and a classwork portion. The classwork will pertain to the lecture just given. Classwork will often involve a combination of hand written work, results collected from calculator and computer program output, and visual aids, such as news programs and articles that involve applications of statistics.

    At the end of each class, reading from the textbook will be assigned. The student is expected to complete the reading by next class. 

    Each week, homework from the textbook and other sources will be assigned. Homework will be collected every Monday.

    Each week, a project will be assigned that involves creating and interpretting statistical graphs, performing analysis on real-life data sets, simulating outcomes using random numbers or other applications. Usually, projects will be covered in detail on Friday classes; the student will have time in class on Friday to begin the project and then it will be due the following Monday. Projects will be uploaded to the Google Classroom Assignments tab.

.. topic:: Course Content

    This course will provide the student will a toolset to design scientific experiments, test hypotheses, collect data and then draw conclusions from said data using the principles of probability and statistics. 
    
    Over the school year, the student will study concepts such as sampling distributions, random variables and expectations. They will become acquainted with the ideas of *chance* and *likelihood*. In doing so, they will come to understand how *uncertainty* affects decision-making. They will see the effects of *uncertainty* in the estimation of population parameters from sample data. 

    The student will learn how to describe and see the effects of *uncertainty* in the shape and distribution of data. The student will become skilled in identifying features like skewness, outliers and *normality*. 

    To accomplish this, the student will be taking a look at many datasets drawn from everyday life. Among the datasets the student will examine,

    - `The Challenger Space Shuttle Explosion <https://www.randomservices.org/random/data/Challenger.html>`_
    - `Electric Vehicles Registered in Washington State <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data>`_
    - `Vietnam Draft Data <https://www.randomservices.org/random/data/Draft.html>`_

    The student will use a combination of technology to analyze these datasets. The activities in the class will explore, among other things,
    
    - The effects on bias on distribution shapes
    - Constructing sampling distributions
    - How to test hypotheses using control groups
    - Identifying correlation in bivariate data and utilizing it to make predictions
    - Simulating random outcomes to visualize the Law of Large Numbers

.. topic:: Project Overview 

    Below, some of the projects that will be completed by the student are broken down by unit.

    In Unit One, the student will examine categorical frequency distributions using the `Electric Vehicles Registered in Washington State <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data>`_ dataset. They will also examine distribution shapes with histograms using datasets such as `Old Faithful Eruption Times<https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/=data/faithful.dat>`_, and `Length of Roman Emperor Reigns <https://historum.com/t/league-table-of-roman-emperors-by-length-of-reign.21418/>`_ 

    In Unit Two, the student will study and visualize the correlation in datasets such `Celebrity Twitter Data<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/top-1000-twitter-celebrity-tweets-embeddings>`_ and `Challenger Explosion <https://www.randomservices.org/random/data/Challenger.html>`_ datasets. They will use this correlation to find the line of best fit. They will use the linear regression equation to make predictions and learn to interpret the meaning of residuals.

    In Unit Three, the student will learn how to detect and prevent bias using the `Vietnam Draft Data <https://www.randomservices.org/random/data/Draft.html>`_ dataset. 

    In Unit Four, the student will create simulations of random variables using software to generate random numbers. 

    In Unit Five, the student will take the idea of simulation and use it to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem. In the process, the student will construct theoretical sampling distributions to see how the Central Limit Theorem arises naturally from random variation.

    In Unit 5 - 6, the student will apply statistical reasoning to determine whether sufficient evidence can be found in a sample of data to draw conclusions. They will set up null and alternate hypotheses, calculate test statistics and apply statistical inference. The student will examine datasets such as `Avocado Prices <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices>`_, `Diamond Prices <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds>`_, `Marvel Movies <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/marvel-movies>`_, among many others.

    In addition, if time permits, the following topics will be covered:
    
    - the student will learn how to apply Monte Carlo Simulation to model financial outcomes
    - the student will interact with machine learning programs to see how linear regression is applied in the real world.


.. topic:: Text

    Reading will be assigned from `The Practice of Statistics (for the AP Exam) <https://www.bfwpub.com/high-school/us/product/The-Practice-of-Statistics/p/1319113338>`_ by Daren S. Starnes and Josh Tabor (ISBN: 9781319113339), 6 :sup:`th` edition. This textbook will distributed to students on the first day of class. It expected the students will bring the textbook to class every day. Most, but not all (see next paragraph), reading and homework be will assigned from this textbook.

    Several units of this text will be supplemented with chapters from an online textbook library, `OpenStax <https://openstax.org>`_. We be using the `Contemporary Mathematics textbook <https://openstax.org/details/books/contemporary-mathematics>`_ and the `Introductory Statistics textbook <https://openstax.org/details/books/introductory-statistics>`_ at several points in the class. Reading and homework will be assigned from these textbooks at various points in the class.
    
    We will be using **Chapter 1: Set Theory** and **Chapter 7: Probability** from the `Contemporary Mathematics textbook <https://openstax.org/details/books/contemporary-mathematics>`_ when we cover **Unit 4** from the *Starnes & Tabor* textbook.
    
    We will be using **Chapter 6: Normal Distribution** and **Chapter 7: The Central Limit Theorem** from the `Introductory Statistics textbook <https://openstax.org/books/introductory-statistics>`_ when we cover **Unit 5** from the *Starnes & Tabor* textbook.

    We will be using **Chapter 8: Confidence Intervals** from `Introductory Statistics <https://openstax.org/books/introductory-statistics>`_ when we cover **Unit 6** and **Unit 7** from the *Starnes & Tabor* textbook.

    The online :ref:`class_notes` will also serve as reference material for many of the subjects discussed in class.

.. topic:: Technology 

    TI-84
        The student is expected to bring a calculator from the `TI-84 series <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84_Plus_series>`_ of calculators to class every day. It is important the calculator is a *TI-84* and not one of the older *TI-83*. `TI Connect CE <https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw>`_ will be used to transmit datasets to students during class. This software will only integrate with calculators from the *TI-84* series.

    ChromeBook
        The student is expected to bring the ChromeBook they have been provided to class every day. It should be fully-charged. The student will need this to access online resources such as projects and datasets.

    Python 3
        Students will be shown how to install `Python3 <https://python.org>`_ on their ChromeBooks very early in the class schedule. **Python 3** will be used to perform data analysis and generate graphical representations of data. Statistical graphs will be generated using `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_.

        All :ref:`projects` and some class work will be done **Python 3**. In each case, the student will write programs that perform statistical analysis and interpret the results.  

.. topic:: Google Classroom

    Any and all announcements will be posted to the Google Classroom. Any assignments or projects that are completed on the student's ChromeBook will be uploaded to Google as zip files. The code to join the classroom is given below,

    Classroom Code
        Will be distributed on the first class date.

.. topic:: Website

    All of the class notes, classwork, homework and projects for this class can be found at `https://bishopwalshmath.org/ <https://bishopwalshmath.org/>`_. This site includes references to additional resources, such as datasets used in class, tutorial videos and links to relevant Python documentation.
